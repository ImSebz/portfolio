## Create React App (CRA)

This portfolio website was built using Create React App (CRA), a popular tool for creating React applications with a minimal setup.

### Properties

- **React**: CRA uses React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, as its core framework.
- **Zero Configuration**: CRA sets up the development environment with a pre-configured build system, development server, and more, so you can focus on writing code.
- **Hot Reloading**: It includes hot reloading, which allows you to see changes in real-time as you develop.
- **Optimized Build**: CRA optimizes your application for production with minification, code splitting, and caching.
- **ES6+ Support**: Write modern JavaScript (ES6+) with support for JSX syntax.

### Animate.css

I've used Animate.css to add smooth animations to various elements of the website, providing an engaging user experience. You can learn more about Animate.css [here](https://animate.style/).

### Font Awesome

Font Awesome icons have been integrated into the website to enhance its visual appeal and functionality. You can explore Font Awesome icons and usage [here](https://fontawesome.com/icons).
